1. Option 1 because new code can mess up the old code already present/unknown issues can be present when new code is pushed.
2. Yes
3. No, the "message" feature seems to consist of two parts, writing a message and sending a message to another user. Unit testing appears to only allow individual components to be tested. Will be unsure how the two components interact with each other.
4. Yes, the "max message length" appears to be only one component, which unit testing can handle.
